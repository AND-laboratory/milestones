to family, coming out to friends, self-identifying, first sexual attraction) in Australia's Generation-Z. We are interested in exploring associations between milestone sequence(s) and several social-emotional outcomes in emerging adulthood.<br>\n<br>\nYou will be asked to complete an online questionnaire for approximately 20 minutes, and attend an <em><strong><u>optional<\/u><\/strong><\/em> follow-up Zoom interview where you can elaborate on your own experience and management of the SID milestones. For the interview, we will be particularly interested in the impact of social media, social support and cohort defining events (such as the same-sex marriage postal vote in 2017) on your sexual identity development.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Who can participate?<\/strong><br>\nWe are looking for young people and emerging adults who identify as LGBTQIA+, live in Australia, and who are part of Gen-Z (born from 1997 and onward). Please note, you must be 16 years or older to participate in the current study.<br><br><b>Reimbursement<\/b><br>In appreciation of your time for participating in the follow-up interview, you will receive a $35 Coles\/Myer e-gift card; this will be the only direct benefit to you for participation in this study.
